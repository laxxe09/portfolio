          Like many fans, I spent hours organizing Pok√©mon cards in a binder, trading with friends,
          and celebrating shiny pulls. But I wanted a way to relive that joy without risking damage to my cards
          or carrying a binder around.
        </p>
        <p>
          That‚Äôs when I decided to build a virtual <strong>Pok√©monBinder</strong>,  a web app 
          where I can log my collection,
          organize it by sets or types, and share it with others online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can upload cards, tag them by generation or rarity, and show off their collection visually.
          It's designed for collectors who want a modern, safe, and fun way to manage their cards.
        </p>
        <p>
        I used TypeScript for a smoother development experience 
         and styled the interface with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.
          One of the key features of the app is its integration with the <strong>Pok√©mon TCG API</strong>,
           which allows users to search for cards and fetch real-time data directly from 
           the official database. I structured the project using standard React 
           conventions and set up a .env file to securely manage API keys and environment 
           variables.
