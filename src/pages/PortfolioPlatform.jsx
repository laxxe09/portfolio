        <p>
          As part of a design-focused course, my team and I set out to understand how students in HCDE and CSE programs
          discover portfolio ideas and seek critique from professionals. We focused on UW students currently building or
          planning to build a portfolio, especially those looking to enter the design or engineering workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our methods included surveys to quickly gather responses from the community, and one-on-one interviews to gain
          deeper insight into students' experiences. We asked about their challenges, platforms theyâ€™ve used, and how
          they connect with professionals online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each team member recruited and led one interview, while another assisted by taking notes. Survey responses were
          distributed across platforms like DUB Slack and EdStem.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project covered multiple phases including proposal development, survey design, and research planning.
          It helped us understand students' real frustrations and opportunities for supporting portfolio ideation more effectively.
